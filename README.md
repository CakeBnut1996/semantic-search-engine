Local Embedding-Based Search and Summarization
This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight semantic search engine on your local machine using embeddings, a vector database, and an LLM for natural-language answers.
It allows users to:
- Embed text datasets into a vector database (Chroma).
- Query semantically â€” ask natural-language questions instead of using keywords.
- Retrieve and summarize the most relevant dataset using a small instruction model or OpenAI API.
- While the example data originates from crawled HTML pages, the approach works with any text corpus (research papers, reports, knowledge bases, etc.).
